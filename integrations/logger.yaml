# The logger integration lets you define the level of logging activities
# in Home Assistant.
#
# I use this to reduce error messages for specific things,
# so I can focus on log messages that matter to me.
#
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    # I don't want to see warnings about custom integrations
    # deprecations and other stuff.
    # Please note! This is bad practice!
